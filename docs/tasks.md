## v3 Engine (Schema-Driven BOM)

> See spec docs in `docs/phase-v3-*.md`. One-page overview at [`docs/how_it_works.md`](./how_it_works.md).
> Scope: QSHS fence + QSHS_GATE pedestrian gate. v1/v2 routes (`/new`, `/`) remain untouched.

> See [phase-v3-1-engine-migrations.md](./phase-v3-1-engine-migrations.md)
- [x] Write migrations 011–014, 018, 019 (rule_sets, rule_versions, product_rules, constraints, variables, validations, selectors, companion rules, warnings, quote_runs/segments, admin role)
- [x] Scope reduction: migrations 015 (form schema), 016 (layout schema), 017 (input_aliases) dropped — fencing-only product surface means form + canvas are hand-coded and shared across systems
- [ ] Apply migrations locally (`npm run db:reset`) *(requires Supabase running)*
- [ ] Verify all new tables exist, `touch_updated_at` triggers attached, `admin` enum value added *(requires Supabase running)*
- [ ] RLS smoke-tested *(requires Supabase running)*

### V3-2 — QSHS + QSHS_GATE seeds
> See [phase-v3-2-seeds.md](./phase-v3-2-seeds.md)
- [x] Write `supabase/seeds/glass-outlet/v3-qshs-engine.sql` with ordered inserts (products → components → rule_sets → rule_versions → constraints → variables → validations → rules → selectors → companion rules → warnings → pricing_rules)
- [x] Extend `supabase/seeds/seed-auth.js` to create `admin@glass-outlet.com` / `123456` with `role = 'admin'`
- [x] Write `supabase/seeds/glass-outlet/v3-verify-seeds.sql` row-count assertions
- [x] Add QSHS_GATE-specific rules (133mm structural offset, slat cut = width − 86, rail cut = width − 80, side frame cut = height − 3)
- [x] Scope reduction: form-schema inserts (product_input_*), layout-schema inserts (product_layout_*), and input_aliases inserts dropped alongside migrations 015/016/017
- [ ] `npm run db:reset` passes `v3-verify-seeds.sql` *(requires Supabase running)*

### V3-3 — Canonical payload contract
> See [phase-v3-3-canonical-payload.md](./phase-v3-3-canonical-payload.md)

- [x] Mirror at `src/types/canonical.types.ts`
- [x] Write `src/schemas/canonical.schema.ts` Zod validators
- [x] Write `src/components/canvas/canonicalAdapter.ts` (canvasLayoutToCanonical + canonicalToCanvasLayout)

- [x] Port `resolvePrice`, `loadPricing`, `COLOUR_CODES` from `calculate-bom-v2`
- [x] Admin trace gating (`role === 'admin'` → full trace; else `trace: []` + minimal computed)
- [x] Graceful math.js failure handling (try/catch per rule, log to trace, skip on failure)
- [ ] Write `index_test.ts` with 8 fixtures (TC-V3-1 through TC-V3-8) *(deferred)*
- [ ] Manual curl test with QSHS 5m payload *(requires Supabase running)*

### V3-5 — Multi-run UI at `/calculator`
> See [phase-v3-5-calculator-ui.md](./phase-v3-5-calculator-ui.md)
- [x] Build `src/components/calculator-v3/` (ProductSelectV3, SchemaDrivenForm as generic renderer, RunListV3, LayoutCanvasV3)
- [x] Build `src/pages/CalculatorV3Page.tsx` (hand-coded `FALLBACK_FIELDS` drive SchemaDrivenForm — shared fence config form)
- [x] Build `src/hooks/useBomCalculator.ts`

- [x] Wire `/calculator` route in `src/App.tsx`
- [x] SchemaDrivenForm emits `data-testid={field_key}` for Cypress compatibility
- [x] Scope reduction: `useProductSchema` hook deleted, `LayoutCanvasV3 actions` prop removed — form/canvas toolbar are shared across fencing systems, not per-product schema-driven
- [ ] Canvas ↔ form round-trip verified *(manual test pending — requires Supabase running)*

### V3-6 — BOM output
> See [phase-v3-6-bom-output.md](./phase-v3-6-bom-output.md)

- [x] Update "Current Phase" header
- [ ] Cross-link all phase docs + CLAUDE.md sections + how_it_works.md — verify links resolve

## Seed-mapping / Self-serve Seeding

**Stage 1+2 combined (shipped)** — JSON is the source of truth for ALL seed
data (fences, gates, legacy catalog, pricing, v3 engine rules). A Node
upserter writes directly to Postgres via supabase-js. One file per product
under `supabase/seeds/glass-outlet/products/`. `slat-fencing.sql` has been
disabled (renamed `.sql.disabled`); `organizations.sql` is the only
remaining SQL seed. Products table is now flat (`parent_id` unused) with a
`product_type` column ('fence' | 'gate' | 'other') and a
`compatible_with_system_types` array that lets a gate declare which fences
it pairs with. QSHS_GATE renamed to QS_GATE (shared across QSHS/VS/XPL/BAYG).
Enables reliable LLM authoring and sets up an in-app AI import feature later
(see `docs/seed-data-mapping-spec.md`).

- [x] JSON Schemas for every engine + catalog table (`supabase/seeds/schemas/*.schema.json`)
- [x] Wrapper schema `product-file.schema.json` — LLM output contract for per-variant files
- [x] Per-product file layout: 7 files under `supabase/seeds/glass-outlet/products/` (qshs, vs, xpl, bayg, qs_gate, gate_legacy, other)
- [x] Migration 022 — flatten products, add `product_type` + `compatible_with_system_types`
- [x] Rename QSHS_GATE → QS_GATE (its own file, `compatible_with_system_types: ['QSHS','VS','XPL','BAYG']`)
- [x] Migrate slat-fencing.sql content into JSON (catalog + pricing + 4 fence products + 12 inactive families); rename original to `.sql.disabled`

### v3 UI polish + v2 retirement (shipped)

- [x] Searchable fence-only product dropdown (`ProductSelectV3` rewritten as a typeahead, filters `product_type='fence'`)
- [x] Data-driven job settings — `useProductVariables` hook loads `product_variables` from Postgres; `FALLBACK_FIELDS` deleted
- [x] `SchemaDrivenForm` wraps fields at 1/3 width on desktop (responsive flex grid)
- [x] Gate management UI — `GateListV3` + `GateFormV3` modal, backed by canonical payload QS_GATE runs
- [x] Extra items panel — typeahead against existing SKUs (via `search-products`) + create-on-the-fly for one-off lines
- [x] v2 retired — `CalculatorPage`, `src/components/calculator/*`, `useCalculatorBOM`, `useFenceProducts`, `calculate-bom-v2` edge function all deleted. `/` redirects to `/calculator`.
- [ ] v1 (`/new`, `MainApp`, `calculate-bom`) removal — deferred to a future pass.
- [x] `dump-to-json.js` emits per-variant wrapped files
- [x] `seed-products.js` Node upserter — validates each file, resolves FKs by business keys, upserts all sections via supabase-js, runs post-check row-count floors
- [x] Migration 020 — unique indexes on engine tables (upsert conflict targets)
- [x] Migration 021 — RLS across all engine + catalog tables (authenticated SELECT org-scoped on engine config; deny-by-default on `product_components` + `pricing_rules`)
- [x] `npm run seed:products` wired in; `db:reset` runs it after migrations + slat-fencing.sql
- [x] Round-trip verified: upsert → dump → identical JSON; dup-SKU sanity test passes
- [x] RLS smoke test: authenticated user sees engine rows, denied on pricing/components
- [x] Portable mapping spec at `docs/seed-data-mapping-spec.md`
- [x] Claude skill at `.claude/skills/seed-mapper/` (SKILL.md + schema-catalogue + expression-syntax + worked examples for QSHS_GATE and a hypothetical VS system)
- [ ] Stage 3 — in-app AI import feature backed by the same JSON Schemas (not scheduled)

---

## Done

- **Phase 0** — Cypress test suite: all 23 test files written, TC test bugs fixed (TC3, TC4, TC11, TC12, TC14, TC17, TC24), failures documented in `docs/cypress-test-report.md`
- **Phase 1** — Foundation: Vite + React + TS scaffolded, Tailwind v3 + PostCSS configured, all 6 SQL migrations written, auth components built (LoginForm, SignUpForm, AuthGuard, useAuth), AppShell + Header built, React Router configured. *(Supabase CLI install + migration apply pending.)*
- **Phase 2** — Fence Configuration: Zod schema, FenceConfigContext (useReducer, XPL enforcement), FenceConfigForm (RHF + Zod, all data-testid attrs), ColourSelect, SlatSizeSelect, SlatGapSelect, AccordionSection, FormField, constants. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors.
- **V3 Planning** — Reviewed `qshs_mvp_build_pack/` + `qshs_gates_build_pack/`, wrote 7 phase specs (`docs/phase-v3-*.md`), one-page overview (`docs/how_it_works.md`), updated CLAUDE.md with v3 architecture, added v3 section to `docs/tasks.md`.

---

## Notes

- The existing `index.html` is the **functional specification for v1** — every form field, dropdown, and validation rule must be reproduced in the v1 React app (except the two AI features deferred)
- **Deferred features** (do NOT build): AI job description parsing, AI BOM review
- All prices and BOM logic must live in Supabase Edge Functions — never in the client bundle
- Currency: AUD, GST: 10%, measurements: metric (mm / m)
- **v3 scope is fencing-only.** QSHS fence + QSHS_GATE in MVP. Post-MVP phases add VS/XPL/BAYG via new seed rows, then QSVS/QSGH/HSSG gate families, then patios-as-fences. All fencing systems share one hand-coded form and canvas toolbar; per-product differences live in the BOM engine seed data. Non-fence products (balustrades, pool fencing that isn't slat-based, etc.) are out of scope.
