## Audio Prompting (Native in Veo 3.1)

Veo 3.1 generates synchronized audio natively. Include audio cues in your prompts:

### Dialogue
Use quotes with emotion/delivery cues:
- "Hello, world!" she says excitedly
- A man murmurs, "This must be it. That's the secret code."
- "What did you find?" the woman whispers nervously

### Ambient Sounds
Describe the soundscape:
- rain pattering on windows
- city traffic humming in the background
- wind rustling through autumn leaves
- waves crashing on rocks
- birds chirping at dawn
- footsteps echoing in an empty corridor

### Music/Mood Cues
- tense silence broken by a heartbeat
- upbeat electronic music
- dramatic orchestral swell
- soft piano melody
- pulsing bass rhythm
- nostalgic acoustic guitar

## Generation Modes

| Mode | Parameters | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| Text-to-Video | prompt only | General creative generation |
| Image-to-Video | firstFrameImage | Animate a photo, consistent starting point |
| Frame-Controlled | firstFrameImage + lastFrameImage | Transitions, morphs (requires 8s) |
| Style-Guided | referenceImages (up to 3) | Consistent visual style across videos |

## Style References

4. **Include lighting**: Lighting sets the mood more than anything
5. **Use style references**: Reference film styles for consistent aesthetics
6. **Consider duration**: Match content complexity to video length
7. **Use referenceImages**: For style consistency across multiple videos
8. **Test with fast mode**: Iterate quickly before using standard quality
